                Is your home located next to a busy road or business where cars idle?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                If you live on a busy road or where cars idle you are likely to be
                subjected to higher levels of motor vehicle pollutants. Motor vehicles
                emit exhaust gases into the air such as carbon monoxide, oxides of
                nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulates, along with evaporative emission
                otherwise known as fuel vapours. An Australian EPA (Environmental
                Protection Agency) study (EPA Publication 789) found a link between high
                levels of fine particles, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide
                and an increase in the number of hospital admissions for respiratory and
                cardiovascular disease.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                If opening your windows subjects you to these fumes you may like to opt
                for an air purifier to assist you to keep your indoor air clean.

                Do you use chemical pesticides around the exterior of the house or
                garden?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Let&amp;#8217;s state the obvious &amp;#8211; pesticides are designed to kill pests!
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Many pesticides can also pose a risk to human health. In some instances
                you will not find ingredients listed on the product label as the
                manufacturer may be protecting their secret formula. But this means you
                don&amp;#8217;t really know what chemicals you are using in your home. Just
                because a product is being sold does not mean it is safe. In many
                countries products such as these are not tested for human health.
                Children are more susceptible to pesticides given their size and there
                is much documented about the connection between pesticides and health
                issues.

                If you don&amp;#8217;t know &amp;#8211; we strongly suggest you contact a local licensed
                asbestos assessor to give you a report as to where you may have this
                material so that you can avoid disturbing it, unless done safely to
                protect your health. Asbestos should not be disturbed unless you are
                following safety guidelines. Once it has been removed it requires safe
                disposal to avoid harming others. Asbestos exposure can be fatal years
                after exposure. Asbestos has been named a carcinogen in many countries.

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Mould around the exterior of the house can impact on the interior
                materials and quality of air inside the home. Check that land drainage
                is adequate, that spouting and downpipes are in good working order and
                there are no cracks or holes in the roof or wall structures. Excess
                moisture around the home can lead to mould growth and material

                Has your home been freshly painted within the last 2 years?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Freshly painted surfaces are higher in VOCs in the period of time
                directly after painting. The level of VOCs emitted from paintwork in the
                home will depend on the type of paint. Consider opting for low VOC or No
                VOC brands when choosing paint. You can choose from plant based paints
                or petroleum based paints. If choosing a petroleum based paint, water
                based paints are healthier options rather than solvent based paints.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                If starting a painting project it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to keep children out of
                freshly painted areas for the first few weeks while the space is aired
                out and until the highest levels of VOCs have dissipated.

                Plasticised wallpapers may contain PVC that contains volatile organic

                Are any of your walls are made from asbestos sheeting?

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Asbestos is known to cause serious health problems. Asbestos was used to
                create various products used in housing prior to the mid 1980&amp;#8217;s and may
                still be used in some countries. Asbestos sheeting was used for many
                purposes, often for wet area surfaces hidden behind tiles, for walls, or
                eaves around a house.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Asbestos contains small particles that if disturbed can cause serious
                health problems. Have an asbestos audit done on your home and ensure
                that asbestos is safely removed by a specialist.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Asbestos was also used for many other products and should be avoided or
                treated with caution.

                Is there cracked and peeling paint on any of the walls?

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Houses painted before 1970 in Australia may have been painted with paint
                containing high levels of lead. Modern household paints contain less
                than 1% lead, however renovating or repairing old paint surfaces can
                expose lead from old paint and can contaminate surfaces and cause lead
                poisoning.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems particularity
                for children. Lead has been associated with a wide range of health
                issues such as behavioural, growth and cognitive issues in children and
                nervous system, cardiovascular and kidney health issues among others for
                adults.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Purchase a lead test kit from the local hardware store and test if your
                old paintwork contains lead before you disturb it. Lead is only a danger
                once disturbed. Consider repainting the substrate without disturbing the
                original surface or replace the substrate or hire a professional to
                remove the lead paint safely.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                A study of phthalates in indoor dust and their association with building
                characteristics by Gustaf Bornehag and others published by Environment
                Health Perspectives found a dose response relationship between
                concentrations of phthalates (plastic softeners) in bedroom dust and the
                likelihood of being diagnosed with asthma, rhinitis or eczema. Studies
                suggest that plastic softeners can find their way into household dust

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Mould can cause a range of health issues such as fatigue, weakened
                immune system and contribute to allergy symptoms.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Mould in the home indicates a problem with moisture and could be a
                result of a structural problem such as leaks, poor drainage, flooding,
                rising damp, condensation or humidity. Removing and preventing mould
                will assist with minimising maintenance expenses but importantly will
                prevent mould spores from growing and impacting on indoor air quality
                and your health. When moulds are disturbed they release spores into the
                air.

                Do you have plasticised window coverings such as blinds or curtains?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                When heated plastics release VOCs (volatile organic compounds), better
                known as gases or fumes.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Plasticised window coverings receive direct sunlight and heat up in the
                window and contribute to poor indoor air quality. Some plasticised
                fabrics can contain phthalate chemicals (plastic softeners) that have
                been found to migrate into household dust and linked with health
                concerns.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Opt for window furnishings free from plastics. Natural fibres or
                naturally treated timber are a great option.

                Do you use a HEPA vacuum cleaner to remove dust from your house?

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air. A HEPA filter is a type
                of mechanical air filter that works by forcing air through a fine mesh
                filter that traps harmful particles.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                A HEPA filter vacuum used to clean the home minimises the spread of
                household dust that may be polluted with chemicals that have migrated
                from household products, as well as eliminating pollens, pet dander and
                dust mites.

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Door mats assist to trap unwanted particles from entering the home and
                accumulating in household dust.
                &lt;/p&gt;

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Taking shoes off at the front door prevents germs, bacteria, chemical

                Many cleaning products do not list all their ingredients on the label

                leave residues on surfaces around the home creating opportunities for

                The issue of Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is receiving increasing
                attention globally in relation to health concerns and health
                sensitivities. Many hours are spent sleeping. Eliminating sources in the
                bedroom is a precautionary approach to ensure you get a healthy, good
                night sleep.

                Remove electrical devices from the bedroom; avoid metal bed frames and
                mattresses with metal springs as metal tends to intensify
                electromagnetic fields. Demand switches and other shielding options are
                available for those who wish to take further action.

                Minimising dust in the bedroom helps to promote good indoor air quality
                for optimal health, as dust can circulate with movement, heating and
                cooling. Dust can contribute to allergies and asthma.

                &lt;p&gt;
                Creating storage that is concealed prevents surface dust from collecting
                on items over time. Opt for shelving with doors, storage boxes with lids

                Research has shown that air inside the home is often many times more
                polluted than the air outside the home.

                can also be beneficial.

                Is there a musty mould smell in the bathroom?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Safely remove the mould and fix the cause.

                &lt;p&gt;
                Tips to avoiding mould in the bathroom are:
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                Shorter, cooler showers minimises the build-up of steam
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                Use a ceiling exhaust fan during and shortly after showering to remove
                steam and help dehumidify the air
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                If the bathroom has a window keep it open when possible for air
                circulation
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                Wipe down wet surfaces after finishing in the bathroom
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                Clean the bathroom regularly to avoid mould growth
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                Hang towels where they will dry as wet towels in a bathroom all day
                create a damp environment.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                Do you see any signs of water damage?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Mould thrives in damp areas. A common area for mould growth in the
                bathroom is under silicone sealant around tiles. Remove the sealant,
                clean the area well, ensure it is dry and then reseal with a wet area
                low VOC sealant.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Tea Tree Oil is effective is cleaning mould. A 3% solution or 2
                teaspoons in a spray bottle with 2 cups of water (shake well) can be
                used as an alternative to a vinegar solution.

                Does water condense on the inside of the window?
                &lt;/p&gt;</questionText>
            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Condensation is a common cause of dampness in buildings, often occurring
                on cold walls, windows and floors, but it can also occur in roof spaces
                and in sub-floor areas.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                To minimise condensation increase ventilation by using fans for air
                circulation or opening a window.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                In cooler months indoor temperature throughout the home should ideally
                be kept at a constant even temperature to warm surfaces.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Insulate cold surfaces.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Remove moisture sources such as drying wet clothes indoors.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Install a dehumidifier if required.

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                The tissue test is a cheap and easy way to test if you have good air
                extraction from your exhaust fan.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Hold a &amp;#189; ply tissue a few centimetres away from the vent. When the fan

                A Study by the Center for Health, Environment &amp;amp; Justice (USA) found PVC

            <questionInfo>&lt;p&gt;
                Triclosan is an anti-bacterial chemical used in many anti-bacterial

                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;

                Venting the air externally will prevent excess moisture indoors. If the
